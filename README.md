# Openshift OrientDB Cartridge
Upgrading to version 2.0.5
This cartridge provides [OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/) on the Openshift Platform.

**OrientDB** is an open source NoSQL database management system written in Java. It has features of both Document and Graph management, as it’s document-based database, but the relationships are managed as in graph databases with direct connections between records. 

OrientDB is incredibly fast: it can store up to 150,000 records per second on common hardware. In addition, this database supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes. It also has a strong security profiling system based on users and roles and supports SQL as a query language. 

**OpenShift’s cartridge model** to make it easier for independent software vendors (ISVs) offering core services in multiple platforms and for a wider array of cloud ecosystems and marketplaces. This open standard for technology packaging and deployment enables ISVs and end-users to integrate their own middleware, databases, and services into the platform and make them available to PaaS developers building applications.
